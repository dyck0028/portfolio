**Final Portfolio Readme**

All aspects of this website were built to mirror the User Experience Design wireframe that I created, which can be found at https://www.figma.com/file/kkkbtXuuYMx3Y1qz1MEqS8/Interactive-Prototype?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=O96XCspVl85Xxcvn-1

The struggle in making this portfolio website was restricting myself to follow the rubric I had set in the wireframe, while I wanted to add more pages I felt it was best to submit with a portfolio that closely mirrors the wireframe rather than expands upon it (something I intend to do in the near future when improving this site for personal use).
Comments and ARIA was added to elements such as; 
- header
- body
- footer

As well as an animation from the CSS animation library animated.css titled 'pulse' which was applied to the logo link-image.

I overcame time constraints and the linear nature of copying a wireframe but regardless, am happy with this site and look forward to fleshing it out further for future use as my portfolio site.
